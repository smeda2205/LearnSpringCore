In the previous example, we have seen pre setting the value for a member variable in the spring configuration.
That was done with the help of a setter method. hence thats called setter injection.

In this example, we are going to take a look at Constructor injection.

If we have a constructor for our bean which takes the parameters. We can use that constructor to set
the parameter values instead of using their corresponding setter methods.
